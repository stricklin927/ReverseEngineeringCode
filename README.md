# ReverseEngineeringCode
MSU - Homework 14: Reverse Engineering Code

# Overview
For this project I reverse engineered the starter code provided and wrote a tutorial for the code.
In a Google Doc, I wrote a tutorial explaining every file and its purpose.
I also, provided instructions for how I could add changes to this project.

```
AS A developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
```

## Business Context
When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a Node.js application using Sequelize and Passport
WHEN I follow the walkthrough
THEN I understand the codebase
```
